Certainly! I'll elaborate on the solutions in a more farmer-friendly way, focusing on practical steps and explanations. Here's a revised version:

1. Apple Scab:
Solution: Start spraying fungicides when leaf buds just open in spring. Use Captan (2-4 pounds per acre) or Myclobutanil (11.5 fluid ounces per acre) every 7-10 days until a couple weeks after flower petals fall. Trim your apple trees to let more air flow through - this helps leaves dry faster and reduces scab. Also, rake up and destroy fallen leaves in autumn to remove the fungus's winter home.

2. Apple Black Rot:
Solution: Apply Captan (4-6 pounds per acre) or Mancozeb (3-6 pounds per acre) every 10-14 days from when buds break until harvest. Cut out any dead or diseased branches you see. Make sure your trees aren't too close together - good air flow helps prevent this disease.

3. Tomato Early Blight:
Solution: Start spraying fungicides like Chlorothalonil (1.5-2.0 pounds per acre) or Mancozeb (2.0-3.0 pounds per acre) when you first see symptoms or when weather gets warm and humid. Spray every 7-10 days. Don't plant tomatoes in the same spot year after year - rotate with corn or beans. Space your plants well to improve air circulation.

4. Tomato Bacterial Spot:
Solution: Use copper-based sprays mixed with Mancozeb for best results. Apply Kocide 3000 (1-1.25 pounds per acre) every week or so, especially after rain. Always start with disease-free seeds or transplants. Don't work in the field when plants are wet to avoid spreading the bacteria.

5. Tomato Late Blight:
Solution: When weather turns cool and damp, start spraying with fungicides like Chlorothalonil (1.5-2 pounds per acre) or Mancozeb (2-3 pounds per acre) every 5-7 days. Water plants at the base, not from overhead. Remove and destroy any infected plants immediately to stop the disease from spreading.

6. Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus:
Solution: This virus is spread by whiteflies, so controlling them is key. Use insecticides with ingredients like imidacloprid or spinosad, following label instructions. Look for tomato varieties labeled as resistant to this virus. Remove any plants showing symptoms right away to protect others.

7. Tomato Mosaic Virus:
Solution: There's no cure once a plant is infected, so prevention is crucial. Use resistant tomato varieties if available. Control aphids, which spread the virus, using appropriate insecticides. Wash your hands and tools regularly when working with tomatoes to avoid spreading the virus yourself.

8. Tomato Leaf Mold:
Solution: This loves humid conditions, so improve air flow around plants by proper spacing and pruning. Apply fungicides like Chlorothalonil (1.5-2 pints per acre) or Mancozeb (2-3 pounds per acre) every 7-14 days when conditions are damp. Water at the base of plants, not from above.

9. Septoria Leaf Spot on Tomato:
Solution: Start spraying fungicides like Chlorothalonil (2-3 pints per acre) or Mancozeb (2-3 pounds per acre) when you first see small dark spots on lower leaves. Repeat every 7-10 days. Remove infected leaves promptly. Rotate tomatoes to a different part of your garden each year.

10. Two-Spotted Spider Mites on Tomato:
Solution: These tiny pests thrive in hot, dry conditions. Spray plants forcefully with water to knock mites off. If that's not enough, use miticides like Abamectin (8-16 fl oz per acre), following label instructions carefully. Introduce predatory mites if available in your area.

11. Target Spot of Tomato:
Solution: Apply fungicides like Chlorothalonil (2-3 pints per acre) or Mancozeb (2-3 pounds per acre) every 7-10 days when weather is warm and humid. Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing. Remove lower leaves as the plant grows to prevent soil splash onto leaves.

12. Strawberry Leaf Scorch:
Solution: Start spraying with fungicides like Captan (3.75 to 6 pounds per acre) when you first see symptoms, usually after fruiting. Repeat every 7-14 days. Make sure plants aren't too crowded - good air flow is important. Remove and destroy badly infected leaves.

13. Powdery Mildew on Squash:
Solution: At first sign of white powdery spots, start spraying with fungicides like sulfur-based products or potassium bicarbonate. Apply every 7-10 days. Plant resistant varieties if available. Water at the base of plants, not on leaves, and space plants well for good air circulation.

14. Early Blight of Potato:
Solution: Start spraying fungicides like Chlorothalonil (1.5 - 2.0 pounds per acre) or Mancozeb (1.5 - 2.0 pounds per acre) when plants are about 6 inches tall. Repeat every 7-10 days. Don't plant potatoes in the same spot year after year. Remove and destroy plant debris after harvest.

15. Orange Huanglongbing (Citrus Greening):
Solution: This disease is spread by tiny insects called psyllids. Spray trees with insecticides like Imidacloprid (3.5 - 6 oz per acre) to control psyllids. Regularly inspect trees for symptoms. Remove and destroy any infected trees promptly to protect others. Plant disease-free trees from reputable nurseries.
